\begin{abstract}
\noindent Massive, high-dimensional data sets are already appearing in a variety of sectors of modern research, posing new obstacles. These high-dimensional data sets can typically be modeled as point clouds in a $D-$dimensional space, such that it's concentrated near a $d-$dimensional manifold. Thus, we are able to visualize this data as a low-dimensional representation. The well-known curse of dimensionality in machine learning suggests that a huge amount of training data is necessary in order to obtain a given prediction accuracy. Unless additional assumptions are established, picture and signal recovery requires a significant number of observations to recover a high-dimensional vector. Owing to the fact there exist rich localized constants, global symmetry, repeated patterns, or redundant sampling, many real-world data sets show low-dimensional geometric structures. This study seeks to investigate these local structures on a variety of simulated and real data-sets, and discover which properties contribute to certain models performing well or under performing. As a result, we're attempting to investigate low-dimensional geometric patterns in data sets in order to extract features, forecast data, and recover signals.  \\

\section{Background} \label{sec:introduction}

\hspace{5mm}The $21^{st}$ century presents new challenges in the realm of statistical inference and data mining. High dimensional data sets are arising more often, which contributes to challenges in attempting to understand and draw conclusions from such data. For the purposes of image and signal recovery, a large amount of technical expertise is needed in order to recover a high-dimensional vector we're interested in [1].

In addition, number of high school students who used e-cigarette increased by 78\% resulting in 3.05 million and the number of middle school students who use e-cigarettes increased by 48\% bringing the total up to 570,000 between 2017-2018 [3]. Furthermore, as many as one in five U.S. adult cigarette smokers have tried e-cigarettes [4,5]. Current cigarette users could decide to continue smoking cigarettes, or adjust their patterns and begin using both cigarettes \& e-cigarettes, or neither.

Understanding how risk perceptions are formed and how they are influenced by extrinsic health and information shocks is therefore critical to comprehending various usage patterns and developing strategies to correct misperceptions and reduce harmful public health effects. Our research adds to the current limited literature on the subject by providing some of the first assessments of how risk perceptions change in response to a negative information shock and during a phase of extensive government and media messaging about the dangers of vaping.

In this study, I seek to use 2018, 2019, and 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey data to build different prediction models that can predict whether or not a person would consume e-cigarettes. I divide the data into two groups: never-smokers and cigarette smokers. The never-smokers' data was evaluated to establish the best model for predicting the intention to smoke cigarettes in both e-cigarette and non-e-cigarette smokers.

The rest of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces background of existing literature of risk perceptions of e-cigarettes and the effects it has on future usage; Section 3 provides
a theoretical model of the problem and extends an empirical approach to measure the trend in risk perceptions and future usage; Section 4 provides a commentary of the results, as well as supplying an analytic approach to decide whether our hypothesis was correct; Section 5 presents concluding remarks and avenues of future research.


\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}

\hspace{5mm}We sought to implement four different, unique nonlinear dimension reduction techniques on seperate, real-world data sets. The group decided on the following arrangement: Jacob would work on Isomap and Local Linear Embedding, Ruirui implementing the Diffusion map algorithm, and Shrey investigating the properties of the T-SNE method. Each of these methods presents their own set of pro's and con's, which we had to navigate around. Thus, this was not a simple cut-and-paste approach to this paper.  



\section{Local Linear Embedding} \label{sec:Local Linear Embedding}


\subsection{Approach}
\hspace{5mm}We seek to extend a Bayesian learning context for the usage and development of a theoretical model, from which we can test our empirical model on. Consider the set $N$ to be the set of agents in the game. Let $\Omega$ denote the state space of a system, where $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}a_i=1$ denotes that the probability of all actions in the state space must sum to one, and we'll assume $\Omega$ is finite. For each player $i\in N$, there exists the set $A_i$ (the set of actions available to player $i$). Each player $i$ holds a prior belief of the state of nature given by a probability measure $p_i$ on $\Omega$. In our case, an agent holds a prior perception of e-cigarettes, which can be either positive, neutral, or negative. This degree will vary and can take on any value within $[-1,1]$. 

At any given point of play during the game, some state $\omega\in\Omega$ is realized, such that a user has gained new information of the EVALI crisis, and has updated their prior beliefs. Thus, we seek to model a players decision making process under uncertainty. Define a profile called $\gamma_i$ of a standard signal function, and denote $\gamma_i(\omega)$ to be the agent observing a signal of a state of nature. Assume the agent has a $k$x$1$ vector denoting the personal characteristics for each agent, which are likely to affect their belief states. Define $T_i$ to be the different types of players. I define $p_i(\gamma_i^{-1}(t_i))>0$ $\forall$ $t_i\in T_i$, where a player $i$ assigns positive prior probability to every member of $T_i$.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\hspace{5mm}Many teens in the United States report being exposed to e-cigarette marketing messages via a number of outlets. Ads for e-cigarettes may impact teenage beginning of e-cigarette usage. According to the findings of this study, exposure to e-cigarette ads can also impact teenagers' risk perception of smoking cigarettes, which is a strong predictor of smoking start (Roditis et al., 2016; Song et al., 2009). Youth who've never-smoked and were exposed to e-cigarette commercials reported considerably decreased perceived hazards of smoking cigarettes. Regulating the platforms and material of e-cigarette marketing should be examined in order to reduce teenage exposure and the potentially negative impacts on nonsmokers. 


\subsection{Limitations}
\hspace{5mm}For this brief report, we sought to discuss the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. First, we effectively reduced, displayed, and learnt from well-known data sets by focusing on linear algorithms and their ability to extract features that optimize variance in a data set. In addition, we illustrated how these techniques would not be able to decrease data sets with a nonlinear distribution.

Thus, this caused for us to seek out nonlinear dimension reduction techniques. For this, we utilized the following: T-SNE, Isomap, Diffusion Maps, and Local Linear Embedding (LLE). We found that each method had their merits and difficulties. For example, the isomap represents a step forward in manifold learning and was a widely used dimensionality reduction method until recently. Currently, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) had begun to take over the literature. In practice, its relevance can be seen in the large number of machine learning libraries, languages, and computational environments that use it, as well as the large amount of research done by numerous authors attempting to apply, improve, or expand it.

We end by concluding that this study was overall quite successful. We showed a multitude of different techniques, how well they will perform or fail on given data sets, and what to consider when using them. It's always important to note that within the realm of data science and statistical inference, a "one method fits all" approach is likely to fail. You must always be aware of the particularities within your dataset, and constantly tryout new methods to explore and find causal inference within. This
